        <p id="j_name">My coding journey began in 2015 when I was watching the news and saw a segment about Launch Code! I had always
                wondered how programmers put code together to come up with these awesome ideas that could also solve complex
                problems. I could not beleive how programmers had the ability to remember every bit of code that they write. As
                I googled what Python is and what things were created from this language, I began to notice that in fact they
                are not remembering every bit of code, but they are using a technique called DRY.</p>

        <h1>Until One Day...</h1>  
        <p><p>My life would change for the better when I decided to apply for the Summer Cohorse of 2015 and did not get a
                passing score (or a good score for that matter!). I soon realized that I would need more than just my knowledge
                of technology to get into this program. My next option was to try again but before I did, my plan was to sign
                up and search for mobile applications that would teach me about programming. I downloaded apps from Code
                Academy, Solo Learn, Udemy and HackerRank. I went through numerous tutorials on learning how to code, but my
                main issue was looking at coding from a logical point of view, opposed from a computer scientist point of view.
                In so many words; I did not know how to think like a computer scientist.</p></p>

        <h1>The Breakthrough</h1>
        <p>It wasn't until late 2016 when I started to really grasp the concepts and began to partially understand what a
                        code was doing. One thing I admit I did not do but wish I did was; sticking with it even through the
                        frustrating times. I gave up after so much time and frustration, but never really came back to it in a time
                        frame that would benefit me. When I decided to take another shot as passing the HackerRank practice test to see
                        if I was a bit more ready than before. I came much closer than I had in the previous go round; even though I
                        failed I felt good about my minimal progress. My friend told me about coding by this time and I was already
                        interested and he went through numerous tutorials as well trying to learn Python, Javascript, Java, HTML and
                        CSS. We decided to commit to teaching ourselves the very basics about learning how to code in at least one
                        language. I accepted this challenge, but would soon fall behind on my commitment. Time went on and I had gotten
                        discouraged about the fact of teaching myself something so complex without a mentor or tutor.</p>

            <h1>Things will never be the same...</h1>            
        <p>It was extremely hard to beleive that I would be able to grasp some of the new concepts of coding. I have to admit it but, Python has been by fara the hardest language I have attempted to learn. It has taken me ahile to be able to fully understand all that Python has to offer. The way the tech industry has evovled, almost every single process is improved through technology. Engineers are able to put together and build systems more specific to the task at hand. I truly beleive that in the next 10 years, (the generation that is in elementary school now) will have to have a accelerated understanding in Computer Science in order to land decent jobs. The creation of programs for youth, such as, STEM and PROBE are great programs that allow kids to learn the basincs of computer programming, all while having fun!! The most important point that I can take with me is to, "Think Like A Computer". Having the ability to do that incorporated with critical thinking, my dreams can indeed come true with the power of programming!! </p>
